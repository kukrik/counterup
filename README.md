# QCubed Counter-Up Plugin


CounterUp is a QCubed wrapper for the excellent jQuery based reader up by Benjamin Intal.
That counts up to a targeted number when the number becomes visible.

can see example of use.

This control is installable by Composer. To install, execute the following on the command line from your main
install directory:
```
	composer require kukrik/counterup
```
